This version of TeX's europecv package adds support for a website in the personal information section of the CV. europecv is a TeX style for the Europass Curriculum Vitae, which was published by [Nicola Vitacolonna in 2006](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/europecv). Since Nicola is no longer supporting the package, I added the website field and a default translation of the field for every language ("Website"). Feel free to add a more correct translation for your language.
